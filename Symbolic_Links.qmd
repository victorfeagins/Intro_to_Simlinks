## Summary

This article introduces symbolic links and how they can help in handling files particularly data files in conjunction with a coding environment.

## Introduction

Files on your computer are located in a certain location or path that generally looks like this `somedirectory/file.csv` with Unix systems using the forward slash and windows using the backslash. In a coding context when working with data we might reference the data file in the following manner:

```{r}
#| eval: false
my_data <- read_my_data("filepath/to/my/data/my_data.csv")

```

Where `"filepath/to/my/data/my_data.csv"` is the file path to a particular csv file. The small issue with writing code in this fashion is that sometimes file paths can be very long and not robust for other users to utilize the code.

## Intro Symbolic Links

One solutions to reducing long and overly complicated file path is to create symbolic links. Symbolic links act as short cuts to the location of another file.
