## Summary

This article introduces symbolic links and how they can help in handling files particularly data files in conjunction with a coding environment.

## Introduction

Files on your computer are located in a certain location or path that generally looks like this `somedirectory/file.csv` with Unix systems using the forward slash and windows using the backslash. In a coding context when working with data we might reference the data file in the following manner:

```{r}
#| eval: false
my_data <- read_my_data("filepath/to/my/data/my_data.csv")

```
